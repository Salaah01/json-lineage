    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      JSON Linage is a tool that allows you to coverage JSON to JSONL
      (JSON Lines) format as well as iteratively parse JSON where the JSON
      contains a list of objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The underlying program is written in Rust and is built to feed one JSON
      object at a time to the parser. This allows for the parsing of very large
      JSON files that would otherwise not fit into memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, this project contains adapters for easy integration into
      other programming languages. Currently, there is only a Python adapter,
      but more are planned.
